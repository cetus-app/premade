# Ingame-admin
This is the in-game admin provided by [Cetus.app](https://cetus.app) for use with our service.
It allows you to exile, send group shouts, view group information and rank users - all from your Roblox game.

You will need a Group API key to use this. You can get one here: https://cetus.app/dashboard
